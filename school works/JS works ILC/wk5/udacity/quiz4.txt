quiz 4
Which of the following are examples of interdomain routing?
Peering between two ISPs  			 	yes
Peering between a university network and its ISP	yes
Peering at an internet exchange point			yes
routing in a datacenter
routing across multiple datacenters			yes


how can a source router adjust paths?
dropping packets to cause TCP backoff
alternating between forwarding table entries to the same destination    This one
sending alerts to incoming senders as the route changes

where does datacenter(figure) structure constrain expansion?
top level switches

what are some causes of congestion collapse?
faulty router software
spurious retransmissions of packets in flight		This one
packets traveling to far
undelivered packets					This one too


round trip time of 100ms
packet: 1kb
window size: 10 packets
what is the sendin rate in kbps?
800kbps

What are some solutions to the TCP "Incast" problem?
smaller packets
finer grainularity timers             this one
fewer acknowledgments		      this one too
more senders


with speech taking 8000 samples per second
8 bits per sample
find the smapling rate in kbps:  64kbps


with an mp3 taking 10000 samples per second
16 bits per sample
find the smapling rate in kbps:  160kbps


Which pathologies can streaming audio/video tolerate?
loss			small amounts of data loss are ok
delay			Some delay at the beggining is fine
variation in delay(jitter)


Commonly used QoS for streaming audio/video?
making packets		This one
scheduling		This one too
admission control
fixed allocations
