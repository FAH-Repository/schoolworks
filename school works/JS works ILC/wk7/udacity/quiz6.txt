quiz 6
examples of control plane operations?
computing a forwarding path that satisfies a high level policy	yes
computing a shortest path route tree				yes	
rate limiting traffic						no
load balancing traffic based on a hash of source IP		no
authenticating a users device based on a MAC address		yes



reasons for sperating control and data planes?
no single point of failure 			 no
ability to scale to much larger networks 	 no
independant evolution of data and control plane  yes
sperating vendor hardware from control logic	 yes
easier reasoning about network behavior  	 yes


how does control/data seperation make managing data centers easier?
moniter and control routes from a central point			yes
ability to migrate VMs without renumbering host addresses	yes
requirement for fewer switches					no
auto load balance						no


how to cope with scalability?
eliminate redundant data structures				yes
only perform control operations for a limited # of operations	yes
send all trafic through the controller				no
cache forwarding descisions in switches				yes
run multiple controllers					yes


when to use pox?
class project		yes
large data center	no
university research 	yes


what types of problems arise from inconsistent "writes" of network state?
inablity to respond to failures		no
forwading loops 			yes
a flood of traffic at the controller	no
security policy violations		yes


what are some methods of coping with inconsistency?
different controllers for different switches
keeping a "hot spare" replica
keeping the old and new state on the routers/switches  only this one, with two phase commits
relying on the routers toresolve the conflicts


what are some motivations for virtual networking?
easier troubleshooting						no
facilitating research/evolution by allowing co existence	yes
better forwarding performance					no
adjusting resources to demand					yes, because they can be scaled as demands change



which of the following are acharcteristics of network virtualization?
allowing multiple tenants to share underlying physical infrastructure	yes
controlling behavior from a centrillized controller			no, from SDN
seperate logical and physical networks					yes
seperating data and control planes					no, from SDN
